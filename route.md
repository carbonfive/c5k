The start line will be where the beach run/walk path meets the end of Arcadia Terrace.

We'll then:

- Run or walk south towards the Bay Street Roundabout
- Loop down and back under Santa Monica Pier along the bike path
- Head North along Santa Monica Beach's bike/run path to the California Incline
- Go up the incline until it meets Palisades Park
- Run through the park towards the Pier, passing the statue of Santa Monica and Veteran's Memorial
- Walk to the end of the Pier itself to claim your shirt and see the view!
