The start line will be at the the Santa Monica Pier Gates.

We'll then:

- Run or walk north through Palisades Park to the California Incline, passing a great view,
cannons, and classic hotels along the way.
- Run down the Incline and run over the Pacific Coast Highway.
- Turn left to run south along the Santa Monica Beach bike/run path.
- Keep following the bike/run path (not the roadway) to curve UNDER the pier.
- Take a left when you are near the Aerial Rings and head through
classic Muscle Beach.
- Turn left again to pass Chess Park and head up the ramps to the Pier.
- Pass the Carousel and Aquariam and run down the very end of the Pier.
- Walk to the end of the Pier itself to claim your shirt and see the view!
