### When and where is it taking place?

8am June 29th, Santa Monica Walk & Bike Path, and Pier!

The start line will be where the beach run/walk path meets the end of Arcadia Terrace.

We'll then:

- Run or walk south towards the Bay Street Roundabout
- Loop down and back under Santa Monica Pier along the bike path
- Head North along Santa Monica Beach's bike/run path to the California Incline
- Go up the incline until it meets Palisades Park
- Run through the park towards the Pier, passing the statue of Santa Monica and Veteran's Memorial
- Walk to the end of the Pier itself to claim your shirt and see the view!

### How can I get there?

We'll be meeting in the lobby of the Hampton Inn at 7:30am to walk over together to the starting line.

### Must I run?

Run, walk, hobble ... hell, just showing up after the debauchery the
night before is an achievement!
