### When and where is it taking place?

8am June 29th, Santa Monica Walk & Bike Path.

We will be meeting at the run/walk path near the Arizona Ave. Crosswalk over the PCH.

This will be the starting line for our 5k! We'll then:

- Run or walk towards and under the pier to Ye Olde Muscle Beach
- Loop down and back under the pier along the bike path
- Run towards the Annenberg beach house where we are spending Summit the first two days of summit.
- Finally head back to where we started.

### Must I run?

Run, walk, hobble ... hell, just showing up after the debauchery the
night before is an achievement!

### What if I need help?

Don't hesitate to ask for help on the `#c5k` Slack channel,
